# Design System Prototype
(we need better name!)

## Here be dragons
This is not production code. It's a playground for prototyping the technologies and architectural details for the Benchmark component library / design system.

## Getting Started
```bash
 npm install

 # start storybook
 npm run storybook

 # start playroom
 npm run playroom

 # start gatsby
 npm run docs
```

## New Component
To create a new component run the following:

```bash
$ node ./scripts/create-component.js ComponentNameHere
```

This will create a component in the `src/components` directory based on the template in the `scripts/template` directory.
