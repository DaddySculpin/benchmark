## Domain Language

A design systems allows us to define our own Domain Specific Language (DSL). This is the common language used by developers, designers and content authors.

When a "primary button" is used all parties know:

- What it looks like
- It's intent
- How it behaves
- It's accessibility implications

The following guidelines are to keep the benchmark DSL universally accessible. The primary goal is to provide a language with as little friction as possible in conversation, code and tooling.

---

### Universal

Markup should be readable by someone that is non-technical.

```jsx
// BAD: What does this mean for a non-technical person?
<TD><TD/>

// GOOD: Clear intent
<TableCell><TableCell/>
```

---

### Clear

Markup should avoid ambiguity.

```jsx
// BAD: The "2" value is ambiguous.
// It could imply a pixel/percent value.
<Stack spacing="2"><Stack/>

// GOOD: The spacing scale is clear of conflicts.
<Stack spacing="small"><Stack/>
```

---

### Self Describing

Markup should be readable by someone who is new to the system.

```jsx
// BAD: Without any context it is not clear what this does.
<MCMS><MCMS/>

// GOOD: Clearly states
<MultipleSelect><MultipleSelect/>
```

---

### Consistent

Markup should be consistent. Pick one word per concept.

```jsx
// BAD: Two props with the same effect but named differently.
<Switch disabled />
<TextInput isDisabled />

// GOOD: Consistent naming.
<Switch isDisabled />
<TextInput isDisabled />
```

---

### Sensible Defaults

The most common use case for a component should be usable without having to specify props.

```jsx
// BAD: The first button is a "bare" button with no styling applied.
// The "bare" button is a rare use case and the most common use
// case should be shown instead.
<Button />

// GOOD: The primary button is the default.
// Bare buttons can still be accessed by specifying it in the variant.
<Button />
<Button variant="bare" />
```

---

### Property Inference

Props should having naming conventions to help infer what type of data they accept.

```jsx
// Boolean props should be prefixed with either is, can or has.

// GOOD:
// "is" for visual variations
<Modal isActive />

// "can" for behvior variations
<Modal canExpand />

// "has" to toggle UI elements
<Modal hasCloseButton />
```

```jsx
// Events should be prefixed with "on".

// GOOD:
// "on" for events
<MultipleSelect onSelect />
```
